                <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
                <p>
                    These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of
                    the “Tiz” mobile application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products and
                    services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or
                    “your”) and this Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering
                    into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
                    authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your”
                    shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms
                    of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Mobile
                    Application and Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you
                    acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
                    You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is
                    electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application
                    and Services.
                </p>
                <h1>Age requirement</h1>
                <p>
                    You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Mobile Application and Services. By using the Mobile
                    Application and Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at
                    least 16 years of age.
                </p>
                <h1>Intellectual property rights</h1>
                <p>
                    “Intellectual Property Rights” means all present and future rights conferred by statute, common law
                    or equity in or in relation to any copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents,
                    inventions, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to use, and
                    all other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and
                    including all applications and rights to apply for and be granted, rights to claim priority from,
                    such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of
                    intellectual activity which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.
                    This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by the Operator or third
                    parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the
                    parties) solely with the Operator. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in
                    connection with the Mobile Application and Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of the
                    Operator or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection
                    with the Mobile Application and Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of
                    the Mobile Application and Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any
                    of the Operator or third party trademarks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms related to the Mobile Application and
                    Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will post a notification in the Mobile

                    Agreement unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and Services
                    after the effective date of the revised Agreement (or such other act specified at that time) will
                    constitute your consent to those changes.
                </p>
